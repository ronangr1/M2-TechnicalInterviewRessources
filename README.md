# Magento 2 Technical Interview Resources

Hello :wave: to all Magento developers!

This repository is dedicated to the collection of resources to properly prepare a Magento oriented technical interview.

This project serves primarily as a reminder. I do not claim to know everything. If you want to contribute, go ahead! PRs are welcome.

## About the author

My name is Ronan, I consider myself as a Swiss army knife in the Magento ecosystem. I've passed several technical interviews and I've literally failed many times because I wasn't well enough prepared (and also because I have a pitiful level but that's another story haha!).

I found it interesting to share this feedback and to communicate some information about the technical interviews.

You can follow me on Twitter [@ronangr1](https://twitter.com/ronangr1) or on GitHub.

## Maintainers

There is no maintainer at the moment except the author :smile:.
