# Resources for Magento Developers

## Table of contents

### Foreword

Finding a job as a Magento developer is not a real difficulty in itself. There is a lot of work and very few developers who want to work with Magento.

However, it is difficult to find a place to work in good conditions. The best places are very difficult to access and to get there you often have to pass a hurdle and improve your knowledge.

That's why it's important for everyone to know that you can get into certain positions if you have a solid foundation.
